# Multicore Sieve of Erastothenes

This repository hosts a BSP program that allows you to run the sieve of Erastothenes algorithm on multiple cores in your computer.

The program uses a custom C-compiler with a MulticoreBSP package installed. You can run `compile.sh` in your terminal to compile any file. You will need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) on your device.

Once you've installed Docker, you can compile and run the file by running the following command.

```
    ./compile.sh main && ./main
```
